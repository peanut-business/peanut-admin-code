# Official integration module

This optional official module owns Tenant machine credentials, external channel
bindings, outbound Webhook lifecycle, delivery evidence, and self-scoped Tenant
session device controls. Technical OAuth/Webhook transports, destination safety,
and secret cryptography remain in `peanut-admin/core`; this module owns the
business records, schema, Provider bindings, and lifecycle.

## Authorization and public boundary

Every user-facing method accepts a Kernel `AuthorizedOperationContext`, checks
the exact `official.integration` resource and operation, and derives the
Tenant, account, member, current session, and request from the validated Tenant
context. Platform-audience and machine-audience credentials cannot construct
that context. The Application binds these operations to dedicated permissions:

| Operation | Permission |
| --- | --- |
| `machine-read` | `official.integration.machine.read` |
| `machine-manage` | `official.integration.machine.manage` |
| `webhook-read` | `official.integration.webhook.read` |
| `webhook-manage` | `official.integration.webhook.manage` |
| `delivery-read` | `official.integration.delivery.read` |
| `session-read` | `official.integration.session.read` |
| `session-revoke` | `official.integration.session.revoke` |

Session operations are always self-scoped. No account, member, Tenant, handler,
worker, signing secret, token digest, or arbitrary destination address is
accepted from an HTTP client. A trusted application producer may enqueue a
typed Webhook event through `TrustedWebhookPublisher`; it cannot select a
handler or secret.

The target HTTP adapter exposes only these Tenant-audience operations under `/api/v1`:

- `GET|POST /integration-security/machine-identities`,
  `POST /integration-security/machine-identities/{identity_key}/rotate`, and
  `DELETE /integration-security/machine-identities/{identity_key}`;
- `GET|POST /integration-security/webhooks`,
  `POST /integration-security/webhooks/{endpoint_key}/rotate-secret`, and
  `DELETE /integration-security/webhooks/{endpoint_key}`;
- `GET /integration-security/deliveries` and
  `GET /integration-security/deliveries/{delivery_key}/attempts`;
- `GET /integration-security/sessions` and
  `POST /integration-security/sessions/{session_key}/revoke`.

Create and rotate bodies contain only names, scopes, expiry, URL, and event
subscriptions as applicable. Tenant/account/member/handler/secret fields and
undeclared fields are rejected. Machine tokens and Webhook signing secrets are
returned only by the original successful create or rotate response; ordinary
reads never disclose them.
The Admin route uses `official.integration.access`; machine, Webhook,
delivery, and session data then load independently under their own read
permissions, so denial or failure of one surface cannot block the others.

## Schema and lifecycle

The package owns six additive InnoDB tables. The module migration creates them through one
Module-owned migration using `Database\\Schema`.

- `pa_integration_machine_identity`: Tenant key, server-generated identity key,
  name, sorted unique scope JSON, status, token prefix/digest/last four, family,
  expiry, last use, rotation/revocation timestamps, creator, revision, and
  timestamps. `(tenant_id, identity_key)` and `token_digest` are unique. Active
  identities may become `rotated` or `revoked`; terminal states never reactivate.
- `pa_integration_webhook_endpoint`: Tenant key, server-generated endpoint key,
  HTTPS URL, sorted unique event keys, encrypted signing secret plus key id,
  active/disabled status, creator, revision, and timestamps. Secrets are
  server-generated, disclosed only in the initial/rotation result, encrypted
  with AES-256-GCM at rest using the Tenant/endpoint key as authenticated
  associated data, and absent from ordinary records and audit.
- `pa_integration_webhook_delivery`: one Tenant/endpoint/event idempotency row,
  canonical payload, digest, state, bounded attempt count, availability/lease,
  safe result code, payload expiry, and timestamps. States are
  `pending -> delivering -> delivered`, `delivering -> retryable -> delivering`,
  or `delivering -> permanent_failed`. An expired lease records a redacted
  `WEBHOOK_LEASE_EXPIRED` attempt in the same transaction; attempts below eight
  become retryable and attempt eight becomes terminal.
  Maximum attempts are eight. `(tenant_id, endpoint_id, event_key)` is unique.
- `pa_integration_webhook_attempt`: immutable redacted attempt evidence with
  outcome, HTTP status, safe error code, duration, and timestamp. It contains no
  URL, IP, header, body, secret, token, exception, or provider response.
- `pa_integration_security_event`: immutable redacted audit evidence. Target
  keys are SHA-256 digests and metadata is bounded scalar JSON.

Tables use Tenant-prefixed indexes and composite foreign keys. Tenant and
member parents are `RESTRICT`; endpoints and machine identities are retained
and disabled/revoked rather than deleted. Delivery payload is erased after
seven days; terminal delivery and attempt evidence is retained for 30 days and
then purged by an explicit maintenance call. Audit retention remains Host
policy and is never cascaded by feature deletes. Rollback is forward-only: a
code rollback leaves inert additive tables and does not restore credentials.

## Credential and Webhook security

Machine tokens contain 256 random bits. Plaintext is returned exactly once on
create or rotation; only a SHA-256 digest, non-secret prefix, and last four are
persisted. Authentication checks format, active state, expiry, Tenant-bound
machine audience, and every requested scope. Rotation atomically creates the
successor and terminally rotates the predecessor; revoke terminally invalidates
the digest. A trusted feature scope catalog rejects unknown scopes. The
Application reads the exact catalog from `INTEGRATION_MACHINE_SCOPES`; its
resolver returns it only for an already authorized `machine-manage` Tenant
operation. An absent or invalid catalog fails closed. Create and rotation both
re-evaluate the current catalog. Authentication revalidates every
persisted scope against the current trusted catalog before recording use or
creating a principal, so removed or stale scopes fail closed. Tokens and
secrets are never serializable through ordinary records.

Webhook secret encryption uses `INTEGRATION_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY_ID` and a
base64-encoded 32-byte `INTEGRATION_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY`. Missing or invalid
configuration leaves read-only Webhook listing available while operations that
seal or open a secret fail closed.

Webhook URLs require HTTPS on port 443, contain no userinfo or fragment, and
use an ASCII DNS name or IP literal. `localhost`, local/internal suffixes,
metadata hostnames, and every loopback, private, link-local, multicast,
unspecified, documentation, or otherwise reserved address fail closed. All DNS
answers must be public. A validated destination carries the approved IP set to
the transport; adapters must connect only to that set with the original Host
and TLS SNI, disable redirects, and perform no independent fallback lookup.
Every send revalidates DNS. A 3xx response is a permanent security failure.
Address classification uses explicit IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR deny ranges covering
loopback, private, link-local, metadata, carrier NAT, translation,
documentation, benchmark, multicast, reserved, and unspecified space. One
unacceptable DNS answer rejects the entire destination.

The signature input is `v1.<unix_timestamp>.<delivery_key>.<payload_sha256>` and
the header is `v1=<lowercase HMAC-SHA256>`. The delivery key is also the
idempotency header. Payloads are canonical JSON, at most 256 KiB, with a replay
timestamp window owned by the HTTP transport adapter. `408`, `425`, `429`, transport failure and `5xx`
are retryable with bounded backoff; other `4xx` and all redirect/security
failures are permanent. The fake transport used here performs no network I/O.

## Errors and integration status

Stable package codes include `INTEGRATION_PERMISSION_DENIED`,
`INTEGRATION_INPUT_INVALID`, `MACHINE_IDENTITY_NOT_FOUND`,
`MACHINE_TOKEN_INVALID`, `MACHINE_TOKEN_EXPIRED`, `MACHINE_SCOPE_DENIED`,
`INTEGRATION_REVISION_CONFLICT`, `WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT_NOT_FOUND`,
`WEBHOOK_DESTINATION_DENIED`, `WEBHOOK_SECRET_INVALID`, and
`SESSION_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND`. Public adapters map these to generic Problem
Details without SQL, existence leaks, addresses, token material, or secrets.

The Module owns its manifest, migration, Provider, Admin controllers/routes,
permissions and menu contribution. Core owns cryptography, destination
validation, and transport protocols. Application code provides no default
secret, default machine scopes, or network transport fallback. The synthetic
database checks live under `server/tests/Modules/Official/Integration`; they
require the separately registered Integration database and never call an
external Webhook.
