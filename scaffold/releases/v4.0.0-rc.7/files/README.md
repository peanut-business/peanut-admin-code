# Scaffold Product Token

Application identity: `scaffold-vendor-token/scaffold-package-token` (`scaffold-product-token`).

This repository was generated from a versioned application scaffold. Product backend, frontend, database, and public documentation files are managed with baseline conflict detection. Customer code is app-owned only under `server/app/modules/custom/`, `web/src/modules/custom/`, `platform/src/modules/custom/`, `pc/modules/custom/`, and `uniapp/src/modules/custom/`; the stable app-owned files are `server/config/peanut.php`, `web/src/peanut.overrides.ts`, `resources/project-resources.json`, `SECURITY.md`, and `scripts/seed-demo-data`. Customer-added paths that do not exist in the upstream inventory remain untouched. `.peanut/application-manifest.json` records the exact boundary and managed baseline.

Before connecting a database or starting a service, register the environment resources in `resources/project-resources.json`. A fresh install requires explicit `ADMIN_INITIAL_PASSWORD`; no shared default password is supplied.
